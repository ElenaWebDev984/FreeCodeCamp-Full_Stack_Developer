    <h1 class="headline">Scientists Discover New Species in Amazon Rainforest</h1>
    <h2 class="sub-headline">Expedition team uncovers biodiversity treasure trove in unexplored region</h2>
    <div class="author">by dr. emily parker</div>
    <p class="text">A team of international researchers has identified at least fourteen previously unknown species
        during a three-month expedition deep in the Amazon rainforest. The discoveries include a vibrantly colored tree
        frog, several insect species, and what appears to be a new type of nocturnal primate. This finding highlights
        the importance of preserving these vulnerable ecosystems.</p>
    <p class="text">The research team, composed of biologists from six countries, utilized advanced DNA sequencing
        technology to confirm the species as new to science. "What's most exciting is that we've barely scratched the
        surface," said lead researcher Dr. Carlos Mendez. "The area we surveyed represents less than 1% of the
        unexplored regions in the Amazon basin." Conservationists are calling for immediate protection measures for the
        newly discovered habitats.</p>
